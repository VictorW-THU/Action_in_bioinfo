# Action_in_bioinfo
This is **Guijia Wang** from *Tanwei College*, *Tsinghua University*.  
This repo is for the course ***Action in Bioinformatics*** using.  
Wish me myself to enjoy a interesting and harvesting semester.  


## In-class notes of week 1
### 4 steps of bioinformatics
  0. Cast a **question** based on extant biological/medical knowledge
  1. Utilize technology (*e.g.* sequencing) to obtain biological/medical data (*i.e.* **information**)
  2. Utilize bioinformatics tools to conduct **analysis** of such information, such as clean & feature extraction, *etc.*
  3. Utilize extant (or construct novel) **probabilistic models or computational algorithms** for better excavation of latent biological paradigms and conclusions
  4. Cast a **question** based on data analysis and finally explain its biological significance

**NOTE1**  There are two types of bioinformatics study patterns (*hypothesis driven*: 0->1->2->3 *v.s.* *data driven*: 1->2->3->4)

**NOTE2**  The differences between models and algorithms:  
    (1). ***MODEL*** is the scaffold where variables are correlated with each other. In a certain model, we use *parameters* to depict the relationships among variables. For different kinds of questions, 'proper' models should be usesd, from the very basic linear models to deep learning.   
    (2). ***Algorithm*** is the method we use to solve a specific programming problem, for instance, to get the parameters of a certain models. Efficient algorithms may help greatly reduce the running time or storage space consumed by a program.


## My learning plan of this course
1. Aside from '*linux*', Use '*python*' to complete every program so as to command common python-based bioinformatics analysis pipelines.
2. Follow the pipelines on the tutorial firstly, and run those analyses with other overt data, to get more familiar with those standard pipelines.
3. Pay more attention on how those analysis methods are constructed and realized rather than simply how to run extant pipelines, and think whether I can contribute to the opimization of extant models or algorithms. : )
